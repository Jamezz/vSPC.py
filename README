This is a fork of the vSPC.py project [1]. Most of vSPC.py, as you can
see, was written by Zach Loafman. I made this temporary repository to
hold some changes I made to vSPC.py until they get accepted upstream.
These changes include SSL support for connections between ESX hosts and
vSPC.py and console logging, as well as other minor improvements.
